    <h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am a Canadian tech student studying server services and security. <br>
      I created this website to learn more about web hosting and also to learn the basics of github. <br>
      I will also display some of my hobbies and fun projects when I get to doing that! <br><br>
      As always thanks for visiting!<br><br>
